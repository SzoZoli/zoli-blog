- [California’s Gavin Newsom Signs Major AI Safety Law](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/29/technology/california-ai-safety-law.html)

Gavin Newsom signed a major safety law on artificial intelligence, creating one of the strongest sets of rules about the technology in the nation.

**Expert explanation:**
California Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed a landmark law aimed at enhancing the safety and regulation of artificial intelligence, positioning California at the forefront of AI governance in the United States. This legislation introduces stringent guidelines to ensure responsible AI development and deployment, reflecting growing concerns about the ethical implications, privacy issues, and potential harms associated with AI technologies.

The significance of this law lies in its comprehensive nature, likely setting a precedent for other states and potentially influencing federal regulations. The primary focus is on establishing safety standards for AI systems, which could include requirements for transparency, accountability, and bias mitigation. As AI technologies continue to penetrate various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation, the implications of this legislation will be far-reaching.

The sectors most affected by this law will be those heavily reliant on AI-driven applications, such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, and financial algorithms, as they will need to comply with new safety protocols and ethical considerations. Overall, this development underscores a critical shift towards proactive governance in the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, aiming to balance innovation with public safety and ethical responsibility.

- [FDA seeks feedback on measuring AI-enabled medical device performance](https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2025-09-30-fda-seeks-feedback-measuring-ai-enabled-medical-device-performance)

The Food and Drug Administration today issued a request for public comment on a series of questions regarding current approaches to evaluating artificial...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent initiative by the FDA to seek public comments on measuring the performance of AI-enabled medical devices marks a significant step in the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. This effort reflects the growing integration of AI technologies in medical devices, which have the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, patient monitoring, and treatment personalization.

The primary technology driving this trend is machine learning, a subset of AI that allows systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. As medical devices increasingly incorporate these sophisticated algorithms, establishing standardized evaluation methods becomes essential to ensure safety and efficacy. 

The sectors most affected by this initiative include medical technology and health care, particularly in areas such as diagnostics, imaging, and wearable devices. By refining how AI performance is measured, the FDA aims to enhance regulatory frameworks, promote innovation, and ultimately improve patient outcomes, while also addressing safety concerns associated with AI-driven health solutions. This call for feedback underscores a proactive approach to balancing technological advancement with regulatory oversight in a rapidly evolving landscape.

- [Science and artificial intelligence could help personalize brain stimulation for smokers](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250930/Science-and-artificial-intelligence-could-help-personalize-brain-stimulation-for-smokers.aspx)

Science and artificial intelligence combined at the Medical University of South Carolina in a study that could lead to personalized repetitive transcranial...

**Expert explanation:**
A recent study at the Medical University of South Carolina highlights the promising intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroscience in developing personalized brain stimulation therapies for smokers. This approach utilizes repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a non-invasive technique that can modulate neuronal activity. By applying AI to analyze individual brain responses and smoking habits, researchers aim to tailor rTMS treatments to enhance their efficacy in tobacco cessation.

The significance of this advancement lies in its potential to improve treatment outcomes for smokers, a group that often struggles with addiction due to complex neurobiological factors. Personalizing stimulation protocols based on deep learning algorithms could address the varied responses different individuals exhibit to standardized therapies, ultimately increasing the likelihood of successful quitting.

This technological trend merges neuroscience with AI-driven analytics and is poised to impact several sectors, predominantly healthcare and addiction treatment. By leveraging personalized therapies, the study paves the way for more effective interventions in smoking cessation programs and potentially extends to other areas of addiction and mental health treatment, revolutionizing the approach to personalized medicine.
