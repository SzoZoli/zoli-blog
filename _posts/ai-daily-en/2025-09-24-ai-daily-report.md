- [Leveraging artificial intelligence to support students with special education needs](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-to-support-students-with-special-education-needs_1e3dffa9-en.html)

This working paper examines how artificial intelligence (AI) can support students with special education needs (SEN) to achieve their learning goals,...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent OECD working paper explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance educational outcomes for students with special education needs (SEN). This significant development underscores a broader trend in the integration of AI technologies in personalized learning environments. AI can adapt learning materials, provide real-time feedback, and offer tailored support, thereby addressing individual learning challenges faced by SEN students.

The primary technologies involved include machine learning algorithms that analyze student data to identify learning patterns, as well as natural language processing and speech recognition tools that facilitate communication and comprehension. These advancements can lead to more inclusive educational practices, allowing educators to customize their teaching methods based on the unique needs of each student.

The sectors most affected by this trend include education, particularly special education, and technology, focusing on educational software and tools designed for inclusivity. By leveraging AI for SEN, there is a potential to not only improve academic outcomes but also enhance social skills and overall engagement in the learning process, promoting equity in education for all students.
