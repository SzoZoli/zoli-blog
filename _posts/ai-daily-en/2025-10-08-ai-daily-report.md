- [Artificial intelligence wants to inhale my Montana book](https://www.aspendailynews.com/opinion/artificial-intelligence-wants-to-inhale-my-montana-book/article_6be744a6-24df-49d4-ab8b-401793a5a95a.amp.html)

Recently, my publisher told me that a major technology company involved in the development of artificial intelligence wants to use my book, “Stories...

**Expert explanation:**
The news underscores a growing trend in the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and intellectual property rights, particularly in the realm of content creation. This situation highlights the increasing interest of major technology companies in utilizing literary works, such as books, to train AI models, a process often referred to as "data ingestion." 

The significance of this trend lies in the ethical and legal implications surrounding consent and compensation for authors. As AI systems advance, they require vast amounts of data to learn and generate human-like text. This has led to a surge in demand for copyrighted material, raising concerns among authors about the potential exploitation of their work without proper acknowledgment or remuneration.

The sectors most affected include the publishing industry and creative arts. Authors, publishers, and content creators are grappling with how to protect their intellectual property in an era where AI can mimic human writing styles and produce new content based on existing works. As the capabilities of AI continue to evolve, stakeholders in these sectors will need to navigate the complex landscape of copyright law and seek mechanisms to ensure fair use and compensation.

A profile of MIT Assistant Professor Priya Donti explores her approach to applying machine learning to optimize renewable energy.

**Expert explanation:**
MIT Assistant Professor Priya Donti is at the forefront of applying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to enhance the efficiency of renewable energy systems. Her innovative approach focuses on optimizing energy production and consumption, which is crucial in combatting climate change and advancing sustainability efforts.

The significance of this work lies in its potential to accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, by improving their integration into existing energy grids. This technology uses sophisticated algorithms to predict energy generation and demand, enabling better resource allocation and reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

The sectors most affected by this trend include energy and utilities, where operators can leverage AI to manage supply and demand more effectively. Additionally, the environmental sector stands to benefit significantly as optimized renewable energy usage contributes to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier planet. Overall, Donti's work highlights the transformative impact of AI in promoting environmental sustainability and addressing urgent climate challenges.

- [Can AI Rebuild Trust in Government? Denver’s Mayor Thinks So](https://www.governing.com/artificial-intelligence/can-ai-rebuild-trust-in-government-denvers-mayor-thinks-so)

Mayor Mike Johnston wants city services to run as smoothly as DoorDash, betting that artificial intelligence can make Denver's government faster and more...

**Expert explanation:**
In an innovative approach to enhance government efficiency and transparency, Denver's Mayor Mike Johnston is advocating for the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into city services. This initiative aims to streamline government operations, making them as user-friendly and responsive as popular private-sector services like DoorDash. 

The significance of this move lies in its potential to rebuild public trust in government institutions, which have often been criticized for inefficiency and lack of responsiveness. By leveraging AI technologies such as data analytics, machine learning, and automation, the city can improve service delivery, reduce administrative burdens, and provide tailored responses to citizen needs. 

Key technologies involved include natural language processing for better communication, predictive analytics to anticipate citizen requirements, and automated systems for faster processing of requests. The primary sectors affected by this trend are public administration, urban planning, and community services, all of which stand to benefit from enhanced operational efficiency and improved citizen engagement. 

Ultimately, if successful, this initiative could serve as a model for other cities looking to rebuild trust and modernize their government services through the thoughtful application of AI.
