- [US tech stocks hit by concerns over future of AI boom](https://www.ft.com/content/33914f25-093c-4069-bb16-8626cfc15a51)

US tech stocks sold off on Tuesday as warnings that the hype surrounding artificial intelligence could be overdone hit some of the year's best-performing...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent sell-off of US tech stocks reflects growing concerns about the sustainability of the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. As AI technologies, particularly those based on advanced machine learning and neural networks, have been at the forefront of innovation, there is increasing recognition that market enthusiasm may be ahead of realistic expectations. 

This situation underscores a significant trend in the tech sector: while AI has the potential to revolutionize industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and customer service through automation and enhanced decision-making capabilities, the underlying business models and regulatory challenges are still evolving. Investors are beginning to reassess the long-term viability and profitability of companies heavily investing in AI, particularly as initial excitement can lead to inflated stock valuations that may not be backed by solid financial performance. 

The sectors most affected include technology companies directly involved in AI development and deployment‚Äîsuch as software, cloud computing, and hardware manufacturing‚Äîas well as industries leveraging AI solutions for operational efficiencies and market competitiveness. As the market recalibrates, it is crucial for stakeholders to balance optimism with a grounded understanding of technological maturity and market readiness.
