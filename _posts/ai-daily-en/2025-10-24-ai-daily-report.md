- [Increased use of artificial intelligence in police work could cause problems in cases](https://kutv.com/news/2news-investigates/increased-use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-police-work-could-cause-problems-in-cases)

As AI continues to develop and seep into various professions, police departments and public safety agencies in Utah have started using the tool for reports.

**Expert explanation:**
The recent integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into police work, particularly in Utah, underscores a significant trend in the application of advanced technology in law enforcement and public safety. AI tools are being employed to assist in generating and managing police reports, aiming to streamline processes, enhance efficiency, and potentially improve decision-making.

However, this shift raises critical concerns regarding accuracy, bias, and accountability. AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases found in historical data, leading to discriminatory practices in law enforcement outcomes. This is particularly significant in sectors such as criminal justice and public safety, where decisions can impact lives profoundly.

Moreover, reliance on AI can lead to overconfidence in automated systems, potentially resulting in mistakes that may go unchecked if human oversight is diminished. Therefore, it's crucial for police departments to implement robust mechanisms for monitoring AI outputs, ensuring transparency, and involving community stakeholders in discussions about the ethical implications of these technologies.

As AI technology continues to evolve, its influence on policing represents both an opportunity for modernization and a challenge requiring careful consideration of ethical and legal ramifications.

**Expert explanation:**
The recent work by Miranda Schwacke, a PhD student at MIT, represents a significant advancement in the development of sustainable artificial intelligence through the use of electrochemical devices inspired by brain function. This research is pivotal as it seeks to create computing systems that not only emulate human-like intelligence but do so in a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly manner.

The main technology driving this trend is brain-inspired computing, often referred to as neuromorphic computing. This approach contrasts with traditional silicon-based hardware by incorporating materials and mechanisms that mirror the electrochemical processes of biological neurons. This innovation has the potential to drastically reduce the energy consumption of AI systems, addressing one of the critical concerns regarding the environmental impact of data centers and AI model training.

The sectors most affected by this breakthrough are technology and energy, particularly industries focused on AI development, data processing, and large-scale machine learning applications. By enhancing the sustainability of AI systems, Schwacke's research could lead to more responsible and efficient use of AI across various domains, including healthcare, transportation, and renewable energy, thus fostering a future where advanced technology aligns with ecological responsibility.

- [Report on how Arkansas government can use artificial intelligence is in final stages](https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2025/oct/23/report-on-how-arkansas-government-can-use/)

A comprehensive report on how the state of Arkansas can best use artificial intelligence is in its final stages of development and review, according to a...

**Expert explanation:**
The Arkansas government is nearing the completion of a comprehensive report on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) within state operations, signaling a significant step towards integrating advanced technologies in public administration. This initiative reflects a broader trend among governments to leverage AI to enhance efficiency, improve service delivery, and optimize resource management.

The main technologies involved include machine learning algorithms, data analytics, and natural language processing, which can be utilized to process large datasets, predict outcomes, and automate routine tasks. Such implementations can lead to predictive policing, improved healthcare services, better traffic management, and increased efficiency in state operations.

The sectors most affected by this development include public safety, healthcare, transportation, and public administration. By harnessing AI, Arkansas could improve decision-making processes, streamline services, and potentially provide a model for other states looking to adopt similar technologies. This report could pave the way for innovative solutions that address state challenges while positioning Arkansas at the forefront of AI adoption in government.
