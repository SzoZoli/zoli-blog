- [Writers on the Range: Artificial intelligence wants to inhale my Montana book](https://www.vaildaily.com/opinion/writers-on-the-range-artificial-intelligence-wants-to-inhale-my-montana-book/)

Recently, my publisher told me that a major technology company involved in the development of artificial intelligence wants to use my book, “Stories from...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent news highlights the growing interest of major technology companies in utilizing literary works, such as books, for training artificial intelligence (AI) models. This trend is significant as it addresses the ethical and legal implications of using copyrighted material in AI development, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. 

The main technology at play involves large language models, which are trained on vast datasets that often include books, articles, and other written content. By "inhaling" these texts, these AI systems can generate human-like text, answer questions, and improve their understanding of language. However, this raises concerns among authors about intellectual property rights and compensation for their creative works.

The sectors most affected by this trend include publishing, intellectual property law, and content creation. Writers and publishers face unprecedented challenges in navigating the intersection of technology and copyright, as well as potential shifts in how literary works are valued in a digital economy increasingly dominated by AI. The conversation surrounding these issues is vital for shaping equitable guidelines for the use of literary content in AI development.

- [The Dangers of Unregulated Artificial Intelligence](https://sfl.media/the-dangers-of-unregulated-artificial-intelligence/)

Artificial intelligence is transforming everything from Wall Street to warehouse floors faster than any technology in modern history.

**Expert explanation:**
The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping various sectors, including finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and transportation, often outpacing existing regulatory frameworks. The significance of this transformation lies in both the potential benefits and substantial risks associated with unregulated AI deployment. Financial institutions on Wall Street are utilizing AI for algorithmic trading and risk assessment, while the logistics and warehousing sectors are leveraging AI for automation and efficiency improvements.

The main technology driving this trend includes machine learning and deep learning algorithms that enable systems to analyze vast amounts of data, make predictions, and automate decisions with increasing autonomy. As AI systems gain capability, concerns regarding ethical considerations, data privacy, security, and accountability arise. For example, in finance, unregulated AI could lead to market manipulation or systemic risks, while in manufacturing, reliance on autonomous systems may raise safety and job displacement issues.

The urgency for regulation stems from the need to ensure AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly, minimizing potential harm while maximizing benefits across affected sectors. As AI continues to integrate deeper into critical areas of the economy and daily life, establishing ethical guidelines and regulatory oversight becomes essential to safeguard against misuse and unforeseen consequences.

- [Computer scientist petitions US Supreme Court to reconsider AI-generated copyright](https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/10/computer-scientist-petitions-us-supreme-court-to-reconsider-ai-generated-copyright/)

Computer scientist Stephen Thaler on Friday formally petitioned the US Supreme Court to decide whether creative works produced entirely by artificial...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent petition by computer scientist Stephen Thaler to the US Supreme Court addresses a pivotal issue in intellectual property law: the copyrightability of creative works generated entirely by artificial intelligence (AI). This case reflects a growing trend in the intersection of AI technology and legal frameworks, particularly as generative AI systems become increasingly capable of producing music, art, literature, and other creative outputs without direct human intervention.

The significance of this petition lies in the potential implications for copyright law, which traditionally protects works created by human authors. If the Supreme Court were to rule that AI-generated works can hold copyright, it would set a precedent that could reshape ownership rights, addressing questions about authorship and economic interests in the digital age. Conversely, a ruling against AI-generated copyrights could limit the economic incentives for developing AI technologies and discourage investment in the creative AI sector.

The sectors most affected by this legal consideration include the tech and entertainment industries, where AI tools are revolutionizing content creation and innovation. Additionally, this issue resonates with legal, ethical, and economic debates across fields such as art, music, literature, and software development, as stakeholders grapple with the evolving definitions of creativity and ownership in an increasingly automated world.
