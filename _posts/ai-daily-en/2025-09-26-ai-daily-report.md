- [San Diego State unveils first-of-its-kind degree in artificial intelligence](https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/san-diego-state-unveils-degree-in-artificial-intelligence/509-6ec8b872-c0f8-4a5b-898e-4cd7e2088c1c)

San Diego State launched a first-of-its-kind Bachelor of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence and Human Responsibility, in the CSU system.

**Expert explanation:**
San Diego State University (SDSU) is pioneering a new academic path by introducing the first Bachelor of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence and Human Responsibility within the California State University (CSU) system. This innovative program signifies a growing recognition of the importance of ethical considerations in AI development, emphasizing the need for responsible applications of technology.

The main technology driving this trend is artificial intelligence, which encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into various sectors‚Äîincluding healthcare, finance, education, and environmental science‚Äîthe demand for professionals who not only understand the technical aspects but also the societal implications is escalating.

This degree program aims to equip students with both the technical skills necessary to develop AI systems and the ethical framework required to assess their impact on society. It highlights a shift towards interdisciplinary education, combining STEM fields with social sciences and ethics. The sectors most affected include technology and software development, healthcare, and any industry where AI applications are rapidly evolving and necessitating a responsible approach to implementation. By fostering a new generation of socially-conscious AI experts, SDSU‚Äôs initiative could set a precedent for other institutions to follow, ultimately influencing the responsible evolution of this transformative technology.

- [85% of Executives Now Expect AI to Deliver Compliance Gains](https://www.pymnts.com/artificial-intelligence-2/2025/85-of-executives-now-expect-ai-to-deliver-compliance-gains/)

A year ago, half of executives believed generative AI could strengthen compliance. Today, 85% say it will, but it remains untested at scale.

**Expert explanation:**
Recent trends indicate a significant shift in executive perceptions regarding the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing compliance within organizations. A year ago, only 50% of executives believed in the potential of generative AI to strengthen compliance measures; now, that figure has surged to 85%. This trend highlights a growing recognition of AI's capabilities in automating processes, analyzing vast amounts of data, and identifying anomalies that may indicate compliance risks.

The technology at the forefront of this shift is generative AI, which refers to algorithms capable of producing content, analyzing patterns, and generating insights from complex data sets. This has profound implications for sectors that are heavily regulated, including finance, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals, where compliance with legal and ethical standards is crucial. 

However, while expectations are high, the implementation of these AI solutions remains largely untested at scale, indicating a gap between optimism and operational readiness. Organizations must carefully evaluate AI systems for compliance effectiveness and reliability before widespread adoption. As the industry moves forward, establishing robust frameworks for understanding and mitigating AI risks will be essential for unlocking its full potential in compliance.

- [Countries Consider A.I.‚Äôs Dangers and Benefits at U.N.](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/business/un-artificial-intelligence.html)

The United Nations announced a new ‚Äúglobal dialogue on artificial intelligence governance,‚Äù and a new global A.I. panel on the technology's risks and...

**Expert explanation:**
The United Nations has initiated a significant "global dialogue on artificial intelligence governance," establishing a new panel to assess the associated risks and benefits of AI technologies. This move underscores the increasing recognition of AI's profound impact on global society, economy, and security. 

The primary technology at play is artificial intelligence, which encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, and automated decision-making systems. As AI applications proliferate across various sectors‚Äîsuch as healthcare, finance, education, and transportation‚Äîthe potential for both positive advancements and negative consequences becomes more pronounced.

The sectors most affected include healthcare, where AI can aid in diagnostics and personalized medicine; finance, with the automation of trading and risk assessment; and public policy, where AI's role in surveillance, data privacy, and ethical decision-making raises critical governance issues. The U.N.'s initiative emphasizes the need for collaborative international frameworks to ensure that AI development aligns with global human rights and ethical standards, mitigating risks such as bias, job displacement, and security threats. As nations grapple with the dual-edged nature of AI, this dialogue represents a pivotal step towards responsible innovation and oversight in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
