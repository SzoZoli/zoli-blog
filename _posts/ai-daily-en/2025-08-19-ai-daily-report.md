- [Metro State University expanding computer science program amid boom in artificial intelligence](https://kstp.com/kstp-news/top-news/metro-state-university-expanding-computer-science-program-amid-boom-in-artificial-intelligence/)

Reports across the country show artificial intelligence is leading to job layoffs, especially in the tech industry.

**Expert explanation:**
Metro State University is expanding its computer science program in response to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), underscoring a significant trend in education and workforce development. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into various sectors, there is an escalating need for skilled professionals who can design, implement, and manage these systems.

The significance of this expansion lies in the dual nature of AI's impact on the job market. While AI innovations are driving efficiency and transformation across industries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and transportation, they have also led to job displacement. Reports indicate that many layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, are associated with the adoption of AI-driven automation and machine learning, prompting organizations to seek employees adept in these cutting-edge technologies.

By enhancing its computer science curriculum, Metro State University aims to prepare students for emerging roles in AI development and deployment, ensuring that the workforce is equipped with the necessary skills to navigate and thrive in an evolving job landscape. This proactive educational approach is vital to addressing the skills gap created by the rapid pace of AI advancement, ultimately benefiting various sectors that are increasingly relying on AI solutions.

- [Researcher: We can build safer tunnels with artificial intelligence](https://phys.org/news/2025-08-safer-tunnels-artificial-intelligence.html)

Every day, new tunnels are being built through rock across the country. The completed tunnels are safe, but the construction phase presents challenges.

**Expert explanation:**
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to significantly enhance the safety of tunnel construction, a process inherently fraught with risks due to geological uncertainties. Researchers are leveraging AI technologies to predict and mitigate potential hazards during the tunneling phase, thereby improving safety for construction workers and reducing the environmental impact.

The main technology driving this trend includes machine learning algorithms that analyze geological data and predict ground behavior. By modeling various geological conditions, AI can help engineers foresee challenges such as ground collapses or water ingress, enabling timely adjustments in construction strategies. This proactive approach can facilitate better decision-making, resource allocation, and overall project planning.

The sectors most affected by this innovation span civil engineering, construction, and infrastructure development. As urbanization continues to grow, the demand for efficient and safe underground construction increases, making AI a pivotal tool in reshaping how tunnels are engineered. Overall, implementing AI in tunnel construction represents a significant move towards safer and more efficient building practices in an industry that is critical to modern infrastructure.
