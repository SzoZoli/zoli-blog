- [Demonic possession and artificial intelligence](https://anglican.ink/2025/09/19/demonic-possession-and-artificial-intelligence/)

Last Christmas I wrote about angels and AI, a report of the intellectual fruits of a seminar I taught on this subject. The formal title of the course — and...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent discussion connecting demonic possession and artificial intelligence (AI) reflects a growing trend where technology, spirituality, and ethical considerations intersect. This conversation highlights how emerging AI capabilities challenge traditional concepts of consciousness, morality, and agency, prompting an exploration of philosophical and theological implications.

The main technology at play is advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly those used in natural language processing and decision-making. These systems are increasingly capable of mimicking human-like behavior, raising questions about their moral status and the ethical ramifications of their use.

Sectors most affected by this discourse include technology and ethics, education, and mental health. In tech, there is a pressing need to address the ethical deployment of AI in personal and societal contexts. In education, curricula must adapt to prepare students for the moral dilemmas posed by AI developments. Meanwhile, mental health professionals may need to confront new challenges regarding AI's influence on human behavior and spiritual beliefs.

This dialogue fosters a broader understanding of AI's role in society, questioning not just what AI can do, but what it means for our humanity.
