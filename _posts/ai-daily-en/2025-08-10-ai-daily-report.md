VIRGINIA, USA ‚Äî It's almost the beginning of the school year, and classwork and homework may look a bit different with the rise of artificial intelligence.

**Expert explanation:**
The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings marks a significant shift in how teaching and learning are approached. As the new school year approaches, experts are highlighting the transformative potential of AI technologies, particularly in personalizing education, enhancing learning efficiency, and providing real-time feedback to students.

The primary technology driving this change is machine learning, particularly natural language processing (NLP), which powers AI tools capable of generating personalized learning experiences and assisting with tasks such as tutoring, grading, and content creation. These AI applications enable educators to tailor lessons to individual student needs, helping to address diverse learning styles and pace.

The sectors most affected by this trend include K-12 education and higher education institutions, which are increasingly adopting AI solutions to enhance student engagement, improve comprehension, and streamline administrative tasks. The implications of this trend are profound, as AI has the potential to revolutionize classroom dynamics, promote equitable access to educational resources, and alleviate some of the burdens on teachers, thereby enabling a more focused and effective learning environment. 

As AI continues to evolve, its role in education may shape the future of curricula, assessment methods, and ultimately, student outcomes, making it crucial for educators and stakeholders to embrace and adapt to these advancements responsibly.

**Expert explanation:**
Lemonade, an insurance technology company that heavily integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into its operations, recently saw its stock price drop by 70% after an earlier surge of 30% in August. This fluctuation highlights the volatile nature of tech stocks, particularly those in the AI sector, which remain sensitive to broader market conditions and investor sentiment.

The significance of this trend lies in AI's transformative potential in the insurance industry, where it streamlines underwriting processes, enhances customer service through chatbots, and optimizes claims processing. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Lemonade can automate many traditionally labor-intensive functions, leading to cost savings and improved customer experiences.

The sectors most affected include not only technology and finance but also the broader insurance market, where traditional companies may face disruption from AI-driven competitors like Lemonade.
