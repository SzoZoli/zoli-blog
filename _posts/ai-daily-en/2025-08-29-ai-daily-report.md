- [More schools letting students major in artificial intelligence](https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/triad/education/2025/08/28/majoring-in-artificial-intelligence)

More than 100 schools across the country now offer either degrees in AI or computer science with an emphasis on artificial intelligence.

**Expert explanation:**
The growing trend of offering degrees specifically in artificial intelligence (AI) is significant for multiple reasons. With over 100 educational institutions in the U.S. now providing programs centered on AI or computer science with a focus on AI, we are witnessing a concerted effort to prepare the workforce for a future increasingly shaped by this technology.

The primary technology underpinning this trend is AI itself, which encompasses machine learning, natural language processing, and data analytics. These areas are driving innovations across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and education. As more students major in AI, they are being trained in algorithms, neural networks, and data-driven decision-making processes that are vital for developing AI solutions.

The sectors most affected by this shift include technology and software development, where demand for AI skills is soaring; healthcare, where AI is revolutionizing diagnostics and patient care; and finance, where AI is enhancing fraud detection and algorithmic trading. By equipping students with expertise in AI, educational institutions are directly addressing the skill gap and fueling growth in these industries, which are fundamental to economic progress and societal advancement.
