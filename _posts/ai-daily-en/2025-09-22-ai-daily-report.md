- [The Missing Piece Of The $2 Trillion AI Market Is Human Psychology](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/09/21/the-missing-piece-of-the-2-trillion-ai-market-is-human-psychology/)

AI spending will top $2T by 2026 but without human psychology, it falls short. Discover how behavioral AI unlocks judgment, trust, and business impact.

**Expert explanation:**
The recent revelation that human psychology is a critical missing piece in the growing $2 trillion AI market underscores the importance of understanding human behavior in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies. This insight highlights the trend towards "behavioral AI," which seeks to integrate psychological principles into AI systems to enhance their effectiveness in operating within human-centric environments.

The significance of incorporating human psychology into AI manifests in several key areas, such as improving user experience, decision-making, and trustworthiness of AI systems. By aligning AI outputs with human judgment and emotional responses, businesses can create solutions that are more intuitive and effective, ultimately leading to greater acceptance and adoption by users. This is particularly crucial in sectors heavily influenced by human interaction, such as healthcare, finance, and customer service, where trust and emotional intelligence play vital roles in user engagement and satisfaction.

In summary, as businesses accelerate AI investments, the integration of behavioral insights is essential to ensure that these technologies resonate with users, unlocking their full potential and driving tangible business outcomes.

- [In age of AI, invest in good data, innovation to avert ‘disasters,’ tech expert Alwan urges](https://www.mcknights.com/news/in-age-of-ai-invest-in-good-data-innovation-to-avert-disasters-tech-expert-alwan-urges/)

The artificial intelligence revolution isn't on its way. It's here, and LTC providers need to engage everyone around them to keep pace.

**Expert explanation:**
In a recent announcement by tech expert Alwan, the critical importance of investing in high-quality data and fostering innovation has been emphasized as essential for healthcare providers, particularly long-term care (LTC) facilities, amidst the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI). This highlights a major trend in the AI landscape: the increasing integration of advanced technologies into healthcare systems, where the need for accurate data becomes paramount for effective decision-making and patient outcomes.

The significance of this message lies in the fact that AI applications in the healthcare sector can drastically improve operational efficiencies, enhance patient care, and predict health outcomes. However, without reliable data, the potential for AI systems to create misinterpretations or errors increases, leading to negative consequences, or "disasters," as Alwan puts it. 

The LTC sector is particularly affected by this technological shift since it deals with vulnerable populations that require consistent and precise care. By engaging all stakeholders, from administrators to caregivers, in a collective effort to leverage AI effectively, these organizations can not only optimize their services but also ensure that they remain compliant with emerging standards and best practices in AI utilization.

Overall, Alwan's call to action serves as a reminder that as AI becomes an integral part of healthcare, the focus should be on building robust data infrastructure and fostering a culture of innovation to harness its full potential responsibly.

- [2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Can Beat XRP Over the Next 5 Years](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-190000328.html)

Key Points. This insurance technology company has digital features that legacy companies can't match, and they may not be able to catch up with its agile...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent discussion surrounding AI stocks, particularly in comparison to cryptocurrencies like XRP, underscores a critical trend in the financial sector: the growing integration of artificial intelligence in various industries, particularly insurance technology. Companies leveraging AI are distinguished by their ability to utilize advanced algorithms and data analytics to develop innovative digital features that traditional insurers struggle to implement due to their legacy systems.

The significance of this shift cannot be overstated. As AI continues to evolve, it enhances operational efficiencies, improves customer experience, and allows firms to better assess and manage risk. The insurance sector, poised for transformation, stands out as particularly affected, as AI-driven companies can offer personalized products at a speed and scale that legacy firms may not replicate.

Investors are increasingly shifting their focus to AI stocks, anticipating that these agile firms will outperform more traditional assets like cryptocurrencies, including XRP, primarily due to the tangible applications of AI technology in enhancing service provision and market adaptability over the long term. This trend reflects a broader movement towards digitization and innovation in financial services, suggesting that sectors heavily invested in AI will likely lead the market in the coming years.
