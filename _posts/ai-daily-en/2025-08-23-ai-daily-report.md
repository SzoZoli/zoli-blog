- [Why it Matters: Artificial intelligence in classrooms](https://www.13abc.com/2025/08/22/why-it-matters-artificial-intelligence-classrooms/)

Experts say schools can't ignore AI. But the tech also comes with pros and cons.

**Expert explanation:**
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in classrooms is transforming education by personalizing learning experiences and automating administrative tasks. AI technologies, such as adaptive learning platforms and intelligent tutoring systems, can analyze student performance in real-time, providing tailored content and support that matches individual learning needs. This trend is significant because it has the potential to enhance student engagement, improve academic outcomes, and alleviate teacher workload.

However, the adoption of AI in education also brings challenges, including concerns about data privacy, the digital divide, and the risk of dependency on technology. Schools must navigate these pros and cons carefully to ensure that AI serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a replacement for critical teaching practices.

The sectors most affected by this trend are K-12 education and higher education institutions, as they adopt AI solutions to enrich curricula and streamline operations. As AI continues to evolve, its role in shaping future educational methodologies will be critical, underscoring the need for thoughtful implementation and policy development.
