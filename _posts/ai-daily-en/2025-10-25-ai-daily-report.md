- [Garfield County adopts first policy governing artificial intelligence use by employees](https://www.aspentimes.com/news/garfield-county-adopts-first-policy-governing-artificial-intelligence-use-by-employees/)

Garfield County commissioners on Monday unanimously approved the county's first policy regulating how government employees use artificial intelligence (AI).

**Expert explanation:**
Garfield County's recent adoption of a policy governing the use of artificial intelligence (AI) by government employees marks a significant step in the integration of AI technologies into public administration. This policy aims to establish clear guidelines for the ethical and responsible use of AI, ensuring transparency, accountability, and compliance with legal standards.

The main trend here is the increasing recognition of the need for regulatory frameworks around AI, particularly within public-sector institutions. As AI technologies become more prevalent, they offer the potential to enhance efficiency and decision-making but also raise concerns about bias, privacy, and governance.

The sectors most affected by this policy include local government administration, public services, and potentially areas such as public health and transportation. By establishing this framework, Garfield County sets a precedent that could inspire similar approaches in other municipalities, fostering a more standardized and responsible deployment of AI technologies across the public sector. This move is crucial in balancing innovation with the ethical implications of AI, promoting public trust in governmental applications of these tools.

Dr. Ann Bluntzer Pullin joins Scott Mitchell on The Hot Seat to discuss how reliable energy impacts artificial intelligence, global stability,...

**Expert explanation:**
In a recent interview, Dr. Ann Bluntzer Pullin emphasized the critical intersection of energy security and artificial intelligence (AI), underscoring how reliable energy sources are foundational for the advancement and stability of AI technologies. This discussion highlights a significant trend: the growing dependency of AI systems on robust energy infrastructure to function effectively. 

The main technology at play here involves not just AI itself, but the associated data centers and computational processes that require substantial and uninterrupted energy supply. This reliance has profound implications for sectors such as technology, manufacturing, and telecommunications, where AI integration is rapidly escalating. In particular, these industries face potential vulnerabilities in global stability and operational efficiency if energy supplies become disrupted.

Moreover, Dr. Pullin’s insights resonate with broader discussions about the importance of sustainable and resilient energy solutions to support the increasing computational demands of AI, thereby contributing to economic stability and technological growth. As global reliance on AI expands, ensuring energy security will become essential for fostering innovation and maintaining competitive advantage in the digital economy.

- [Undervalued and Profitable: This Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Can Soar Higher After Skyrocketing 140% in 2025](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/24/undervalued-and-profitable-this-magnificent-artifi/)

This chipmaker is trading at an attractive valuation despite recording stunning gains in 2025.

**Expert explanation:**
In recent AI news, a chipmaker has garnered significant attention for its remarkable performance, seeing its stock soar by 140% in 2025. This surge is largely attributed to the increasing demand for advanced semiconductor technologies that power AI applications, ranging from machine learning to deep learning. 

The core technology driving this trend is the development of specialized chips, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are optimized for high-speed computations essential for AI workloads. As industries increasingly integrate AI-driven solutions, the need for more efficient and powerful processing hardware continues to grow. 

The sectors most affected by this trend include technology, automotive (for AI in autonomous driving), healthcare (for data analysis and diagnostics), and finance (for algorithmic trading and risk assessment). The chipmaker’s strong performance not only highlights the profitability potential within the semiconductor industry but also underscores the broader economic shift towards AI-driven solutions across various industries. The stock's undervaluation, despite its profitability, suggests potential for further investment and growth as the demand for AI technologies continues to expand.
