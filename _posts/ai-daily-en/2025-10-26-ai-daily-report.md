- [Avatars, chatbots, robot church dog: How to steward AI at church](https://www.deseret.com/faith/2025/10/25/how-ai-will-transform-churches/)

If you call the Rev. Justin Lester in the middle of the night, there's a good chance you'll hear his voice on the other end. Well, it's sort of his.

**Expert explanation:**
The recent developments in AI technology are significantly impacting the way religious organizations, particularly churches, engage with their congregations and communities. Key innovations include the use of conversational AI—such as chatbots and virtual avatars—that can simulate human interaction, offering support, guidance, and information to churchgoers anytime and anywhere. A notable example is the implementation of a "robot church dog," which employs AI to provide companionship and comfort, paralleling traditional pastoral care.

The significance of this trend lies in its potential to enhance pastoral outreach and engagement, making the church more accessible, especially outside of typical service hours. These tools allow for continuous, personalized interaction, enriching the spiritual experience and expanding the church's reach within the community.

Several sectors are particularly affected, including religious institutions, community services, and mental health support, as these technologies can facilitate emotional connections and provide timely responses to individuals seeking guidance. Overall, AI is transforming how churches operate, fostering deeper connections between congregants and their faith communities.

- [Israel playing catch-up in AI after two years of war](https://www.jns.org/israel-playing-catch-up-in-ai-after-two-years-of-war/)

Artificial intelligence and quantum computing are emerging as the twin pillars of strategic power in the 21st century. They are reshaping how nations gather...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent news highlights Israel's recognition of the critical role artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing play in global strategic power dynamics, particularly in the wake of its military and geopolitical challenges over the past two years. As nations leverage these advanced technologies to enhance their military capabilities and intelligence gathering, Israel finds itself needing to accelerate its AI development and integration.

The significance lies in AI and quantum computing's potential to revolutionize national security, defense systems, and economic competitiveness. AI is particularly impactful in sectors such as cybersecurity, surveillance, and data analysis, where it can predict threats and optimize responses in real-time. Quantum computing, on the other hand, offers unprecedented processing power, enabling faster problem-solving in cryptography and complex simulations that are vital for advanced defense technologies.

The sectors most affected include defense, technology, and national security. Israel, historically a leader in military innovation, must now reinvigorate its position in these key technological fields to safeguard its interests and maintain its strategic advantages on a global scale. In doing so, Israel is likely to invest heavily in research and development, collaboration with tech firms, and integration of AI-driven tools in military frameworks. This race to bolster capabilities underscores the broader trend of nations prioritizing AI and quantum technologies as central to their future security and economic strategies.

- [Tech experts discuss AI’s future impact at Vermont Tech Jam](https://www.wcax.com/video/2025/10/25/tech-experts-discuss-ais-future-impact-vermont-tech-jam/)

More than 1,000 attendees gather in Burlington to explore artificial intelligence opportunities and concerns. News · Dave has your First Alert forecast.

**Expert explanation:**
At the recent Vermont Tech Jam, over 1,000 participants engaged in discussions about the future impact of artificial intelligence (AI), highlighting its growing significance across multiple sectors. Central to the discourse was the ongoing trend of rapid AI advancement, particularly in machine learning, natural language processing, and automation technologies, which are reshaping industries such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.

Experts emphasized that while AI presents opportunities for increased efficiency and innovation, it also raises valid concerns regarding job displacement, ethical considerations, and data privacy. The event served as a platform for stakeholders to explore both the transformative potential of AI and the need for responsible implementation strategies. As AI continues to evolve, its implications will be profound, making dialogues like those at Vermont Tech Jam essential for preparing for its widespread integration across various fields.
