- [Meta Unveils Smart Glasses With Apps and an Artificial Intelligence Assistant](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/17/technology/personaltech/meta-smart-glasses-ai.html)

At its annual developer conference on Wednesday, Meta showed several new smart glasses, which have been a surprise hit for the company.

**Expert explanation:**
Meta's recent unveiling of smart glasses equipped with apps and an artificial intelligence (AI) assistant represents a significant advancement in the integration of augmented reality (AR) into everyday life. This launch highlights several key trends, broadly emphasizing the convergence of wearable technology with AI-driven functionalities that enhance user experience and interaction with the digital world.

The smart glasses allow users to access applications and utilize an AI assistant seamlessly, bridging the gap between digital content and the physical environment. This technology is characterized by its ability to provide hands-free access to information, navigate complex tasks, and deliver personalized experiences tailored to the user‚Äôs preferences and behaviors.

The sectors most affected by this development include consumer electronics, where competition is intensifying among tech giants to create user-friendly, innovative products; augmented reality, as these glasses further merge digital contexts with the real world; and workplace productivity, as businesses may adopt such technology to improve communication and efficiency among employees. Overall, Meta's smart glasses exemplify a significant step toward mainstream adoption of AR technologies enhanced by AI capabilities, shaping how users interact with their environments and the information that surrounds them.

- [Artificial intelligence could help detect ‚Äòpredatory‚Äô journals](https://physicsworld.com/a/artificial-intelligence-could-help-detect-predatory-journals/)

Artificial intelligence (AI) could help sniff out questionable open-access publications that are more interested in profit than scientific integrity.

**Expert explanation:**
Artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful tool for identifying ‚Äúpredatory‚Äù journals‚Äîpublications that prioritize profit over scientific integrity, often by charging authors substantial fees with little to no peer review. This initiative is significant as it seeks to enhance the reliability of open-access publishing, a model that has gained traction but is also rife with exploitation.

The main technology driving this trend involves machine learning algorithms that can analyze vast amounts of publication data to detect patterns indicative of predatory practices. By assessing factors such as citation metrics, editorial credibility, and the transparency of the peer review process, AI can flag journals that may compromise scientific quality.

The sectors most affected include academia and research, where the integrity of publishing is crucial for maintaining trust in scientific communication. Scholars, institutions, and funding bodies will benefit from improved tools that help them discern reputable journals from exploitative ones, thereby fostering a healthier research ecosystem. Ultimately, this development underscores the role of AI in enhancing transparency and accountability within the scientific publishing landscape.

- [China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia‚Äôs AI chips](https://www.ft.com/content/12adf92d-3e34-428a-8d61-c9169511915c)

China's internet regulator has banned the country's biggest technology companies from buying Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips, as Beijing steps up...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent decision by China's internet regulator to prohibit major tech companies from purchasing Nvidia's artificial intelligence (AI) chips marks a significant escalation in China's technology regulations. This move comes amid increasing geopolitical tensions and concerns over data security and technology sovereignty.

**Significance**: Nvidia's AI chips are crucial for powering advanced computing tasks, particularly in machine learning and AI applications. By banning the purchase of these chips, the Chinese government aims to restrict access to cutting-edge technologies that could enhance the capabilities of domestic companies in critical sectors such as AI research, cloud computing, and autonomous systems. This ban may hinder innovation within China's tech industry and push companies to seek alternatives or develop homegrown technologies.

**Main Technology/Trend**: The core technology at play here is Nvidia's AI semiconductors, which are among the most advanced in the world, enabling significant advancements in AI capabilities. The chip technology includes GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) that are increasingly relied upon for their parallel processing power necessary for training complex AI models.

**Affected Sectors**: The sectors most impacted by this ban include artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and technology innovation. Companies involved in autonomous vehicles, cybersecurity, and e-commerce, which leverage AI algorithms for various applications, will face challenges in maintaining competitiveness without access to Nvidia‚Äôs state-of-the-art GPU technology.

Overall, this move highlights the growing divide in the tech industry driven by geopolitical factors, and could lead to increased efforts in developing indigenous semiconductor capabilities within China.
