- [Since the artificial intelligence boom electrified San Francisco, it has fueled a resurgence of live â€” and sometimes futuristic â€” events. https://nyti.ms/4mBMv6O](https://www.facebook.com/nytimes/posts/since-the-artificial-intelligence-boom-electrified-san-francisco-it-has-fueled-a/1186547576661037/)



**Expert explanation:**
The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI) advancements has sparked a notable increase in live events in San Francisco, a city that has long been at the forefront of technological innovation. This resurgence is significant as it reflects a broader cultural and economic shift influenced by AI technologies, particularly generative AI, which has gained considerable traction in various sectors.

The main technology driving this trend is generative AI, which uses machine learning algorithms to create content, be it text, images, or even music, remarkably mimicking human creativity. This allows for interactive and immersive experiences at live events, where attendees can engage with AI in unique ways, such as through real-time art generation or AI-driven performances.

Sectors most affected by this trend include technology, entertainment, and education. In the tech sector, companies are leveraging AI to enhance customer engagement and showcase innovations. The entertainment industry is seeing live performances that integrate AI to create dynamic content, engaging audiences in novel experiences. Meanwhile, the education sector can utilize live events to demonstrate AI applications and facilitate discussions around ethical considerations, thereby educating the public on the technology's implications.

Overall, the intertwining of live events with AI technologies in San Francisco not only represents a cultural revitalization but also indicates a growing interest in the tangible applications of AI, shaping how industries engage with audiences and innovate.

- [Holy See urges moratorium on autonomous weapons at UN debate on AI](https://www.vaticannews.va/en/vatican-city/news/2025-09/holy-see-un-security-council-gallagher-ai-autonomous-arms-risks.html)

By Linda Bordoni. The need for urgent measures to ensure that the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) remains anchored in respect for human...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent call from the Holy See for a moratorium on autonomous weapons highlights the growing concern over the ethical implications and risks associated with the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly in military applications. This plea, presented during a debate at the United Nations, underscores the urgency of establishing regulations to ensure that AI development adheres to fundamental human rights and moral principles.

The main technological trend at play is the development of autonomous weapons systems, which utilize AI algorithms to make critical decisions in combat scenarios with minimal human intervention. These systems can potentially operate faster and more efficiently than human-operated systems but also raise significant ethical questions about accountability, decision-making in life-or-death situations, and the potential for misuse.

The sectors most affected by this call for regulation include defense and military industries, where the integration of AI is transforming warfare. Additionally, it impacts the broader technology sector, where AI researchers and developers are urged to consider the moral implications of their innovations. The discussion also resonates with policymakers and international relations experts, as it raises fundamental questions about global security, arms control, and the governance of emerging technologies. 

In summary, the Holy See's advocacy for a moratorium reflects a critical intersection of technology, ethics, and international policy, prompting stakeholders across various sectors to engage in dialogue about the future of autonomous weapons and the role of AI in society.
