Duke launched its own generative artificial intelligence model – DukeGPT – in June, allowing members of the University community to ask questions specific...

**Expert explanation:**
Duke University recently introduced its own generative AI model, DukeGPT, marking a significant advancement in the application of artificial intelligence within higher education. This AI model, developed to cater specifically to the university community, enables users to ask questions and receive answers tailored to their academic and administrative needs. 

The significance of DukeGPT lies in its ability to enhance the learning experience and streamline processes within the university, fostering a more interactive and personalized educational environment. Utilizing large language model technology, similar to other generative AI systems, DukeGPT can automatically generate text responses based on the input it receives, drawing upon a vast database of knowledge relevant to the university's curriculum and resources.

The primary sectors affected by this development include education, specifically higher education institutions, and potentially the administrative aspect of universities. As institutions progressively integrate AI tools like DukeGPT, they stand to improve accessibility to information, facilitate better communication, and empower both students and faculty, thereby reshaping the landscape of academic support and engagement.

- [How experts are using artificial intelligence to accelerate drug discoveries](https://www.kron4.com/news/technology-ai/how-experts-are-using-artificial-intelligence-to-accelerate-drug-discoveries/)

SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) – As the use of artificial intelligence becomes a more popular tool in drug research, a scientific software company aims to one day use...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are significantly transforming the pharmaceutical industry by accelerating drug discovery processes. AI technologies, particularly machine learning algorithms, are being employed to analyze vast datasets related to biological interactions, compound properties, and clinical outcomes more efficiently than traditional methods. 

This trend is noteworthy for several reasons. Firstly, AI can process and identify potential drug candidates at an unprecedented speed, reducing the time and costs typically associated with drug development, which can take over a decade and billions of dollars. By leveraging AI to predict how different compounds will behave in biological systems, researchers can focus on the most promising candidates, thus optimizing resource allocation in the pharmaceutical pipeline.

The sectors most affected by this technological shift include pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and personalized medicine. Companies in these industries are increasingly integrating AI into their research and development processes to enhance productivity, improve accuracy in drug targeting, and ultimately bring safer and more effective treatments to market faster. As this trend continues, we may see a paradigm shift in how new therapies are discovered and validated, paving the way for more innovative approaches to healthcare.

> **Research/RAG note:**
> The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in drug discovery represents a pivotal advancement in the pharmaceutical industry. One important facet of this research is the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. RAG leverages vast datasets that include scientific literature, clinical trial databases, and molecular information to augment traditional drug discovery processes. By retrieving relevant information and generating insights, AI can significantly shorten the time required to identify viable drug candidates and predict their effects. This method not only enhances the efficacy of the research but also allows for more innovative solutions by synthesizing diverse data sources. As highlighted in the news, the growing reliance on AI tools underscores the potential for transformative breakthroughs in therapeutics, ultimately expediting the pathway from discovery to delivery in healthcare.
