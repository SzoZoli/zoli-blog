- [PAHO publishes guide for designing Artificial Intelligence instructions in public health](https://www.paho.org/en/news/20-10-2025-paho-publishes-guide-designing-artificial-intelligence-instructions-public-health)

Washington D.C., October 20, 2025 (PAHO) – The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has launched a new guide providing practical advice on how to create...

**Expert explanation:**
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has recently published a guide aimed at enhancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public health initiatives. This document provides practical recommendations for the design and implementation of AI systems, ensuring they are aligned with the unique challenges and ethical considerations of the public health sector.

The significance of this guide lies in its potential to streamline the deployment of AI technologies, which can analyze vast amounts of healthcare data, predict disease outbreaks, optimize resource allocation, and personalize patient care. The focus on public health is particularly crucial given the increasing reliance on data-driven decision-making in the wake of global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The main technology at play here involves machine learning algorithms and data analytics, which are central to developing AI systems capable of processing and interpreting complex health datasets. The guide aims to foster collaboration among healthcare professionals, policymakers, and technologists to ensure that AI tools are effective, equitable, and transparent.

The sectors most affected by this initiative are public health agencies, hospitals, and healthcare policymakers. By providing a structured approach to AI implementation, the guide targets improvements in health surveillance, clinical decision support, and community health initiatives, ultimately advancing health outcomes across the Americas.

- [Fake apps become harder to spot with artificial intelligence](https://fox4kc.com/news/problem-solvers/fake-apps-become-harder-to-spot-with-artificial-intelligence/)

Cybersecurity expert Gilit Saporta says "fake apps" don't discriminate; both her children and her father have come to her about smartphone applications that...

**Expert explanation:**
The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in app development has significantly increased the sophistication of fake or counterfeit applications, making them harder for users to identify. According to cybersecurity expert Gilit Saporta, these deceptive apps target a wide demographic, affecting users across all age groups, including vulnerable populations like children and the elderly.

The primary technology driving this trend is machine learning, which enables the creation of fake apps that can mimic legitimate software with high accuracy. These apps often use deepfake technology and advanced algorithms to replicate the appearance and functionality of genuine applications, thus increasing their legitimacy in the eyes of unsuspecting users.

The sectors most affected by this trend include cybersecurity, consumer technology, and mobile applications. As the risks associated with fake apps grow, there is a pressing need for heightened awareness, improved verification processes, and more robust cybersecurity measures to protect consumers from potential harm, such as data breaches, identity theft, and financial fraud. The situation highlights the necessity for continual advancements in AI-driven security solutions to combat the evolving threat landscape in digital environments.

- [Artificial intelligence supercharges science on the Antarctic seafloor](https://phys.org/news/2025-10-artificial-intelligence-supercharges-science-antarctic.html)

New advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming the way scientists explore and understand some of the most remote parts of the ocean around...

**Expert explanation:**
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence are revolutionizing oceanographic research, particularly in the unexplored regions of the Antarctic seafloor. By employing machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, scientists can now process vast amounts of underwater data more efficiently and accurately. This technological trend facilitates the identification of species, mapping of seafloor habitats, and monitoring of environmental changes in real-time.

The significance of this development lies in its potential to enhance our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem dynamics in one of the planet's most extreme environments. With the growing concerns surrounding climate change and its impact on marine ecosystems, AI-powered exploration plays a crucial role in informing conservation strategies and policy decisions.

The sectors most affected by these advancements include marine biology, environmental science, and climate research, as well as technology sectors focused on AI and data analytics. By bridging the gap between innovative technology and ecological research, AI is poised to unlock new insights that will support the stewardship of vital oceanic resources.
