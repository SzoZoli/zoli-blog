- [UCF Launches Institute of Artificial Intelligence to Advance Research, Talent Development Across Disciplines](https://www.ucf.edu/news/ucf-launches-institute-of-artificial-intelligence-to-advance-research-talent-development-across-disciplines/)

The new initiative brings together top faculty, industry partnerships and cross-campus collaboration to position UCF as a national leader in AI.

**Expert explanation:**
The University of Central Florida (UCF) has launched the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, aiming to enhance research and talent development across various disciplines. This initiative is significant as it seeks to position UCF as a national leader in AI, responding to the increasing demand for expertise in this rapidly evolving field.

The primary technology at play is artificial intelligence, encompassing a range of methodologies including machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. By focusing on interdisciplinary collaboration and forging partnerships with industry leaders, the institute intends to advance the understanding and application of AI technologies.

Sectors most affected by this initiative include education, healthcare, engineering, and business, as they increasingly rely on AI solutions to improve efficiency, drive innovation, and solve complex problems. The establishment of such an institute reflects a broader trend in academia to integrate AI research into diverse fields, preparing students and professionals for a future where AI plays a pivotal role in societal development and economic growth.

- [EPA use of artificial intelligence skyrockets](https://www.eenews.net/articles/epa-use-of-artificial-intelligence-skyrockets/)

The agency has recorded 103 instances of AI use or planning, up from 17 last December.

**Expert explanation:**
The recent surge in artificial intelligence (AI) utilization by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is significant, reflecting a growing trend of integrating advanced technology into environmental governance and management. The record increase from 17 to 103 instances of AI use or planning demonstrates the agency's commitment to enhancing its decision-making processes and operational efficiency.

The primary technology driving this trend includes machine learning algorithms and data analytics tools, which enable the EPA to process vast amounts of environmental data, predict pollution patterns, and evaluate regulatory impacts more effectively. By leveraging AI, the agency is better equipped to identify environmental compliance issues, manage air and water quality initiatives, and address climate change challenges.

The sectors most affected by this development are environmental science, regulatory compliance, and public health. Enhanced AI capabilities in these areas can lead to more informed policy decisions, improved environmental protection measures, and ultimately, a healthier ecosystem. This shift not only showcases the potential of AI to revolutionize environmental management but also highlights the increasing need for data-driven approaches in addressing complex environmental issues.
