- [2 High-Flying Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Sell Before They Plummet 74% and 30%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-high-flying-artificial-intelligence-201500744.html)

Not every big AI stock is a buy after the massive bull market run.

**Expert explanation:**
The recent analysis highlighting two high-profile AI stocks that analysts predict may experience significant declines (up to 74% and 30%) reflects broader market adjustments following an intense bull run in the AI sector. This news is significant as it underscores the volatility inherent in technology stocks, particularly those heavily tied to the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence landscape.

The main technology trend at play involves the ongoing surge in AI advancements, which has driven aggressive investment and speculation in AI-based companies. While many firms have seen substantial gains fueled by innovations in machine learning, natural language processing, and automation, analysts caution against potential overvaluation. This suggests that not all AI stocks are equally positioned for sustained growth, highlighting the need for investors to critically assess fundamentals rather than following market hype.

The sectors most affected by these market dynamics include technology and finance, especially companies involved in AI development, cloud computing, and data analytics. As the market recalibrates, sectors relying heavily on AI solutions may see mixed impacts, with some firms facing harsh corrections due to inflated expectations. This situation serves as a reminder for investors and stakeholders to exercise due diligence and remain cognizant of market complexities within the rapidly advancing AI arena.

- [At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, Chinese Premier Li Qiang proposed the creation of an international body to coordinate AI development and safety, warning that AI must not become an "exclusive game" dominated by a few na](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/analytics-india-magazine_at-the-world-artificial-intelligence-conference-activity-7355091214246858752-2AJv)



**Expert explanation:**
At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) in Shanghai, Chinese Premier Li Qiang emphasized the need for a global organization to oversee AI development and safety. This proposal underscores a growing recognition of the need for international cooperation in the face of rapid advancements in AI technology. The significance of this initiative lies in addressing the risks of AI becoming an "exclusive game" for a small number of powerful entities or nations, potentially exacerbating inequalities and fuelling geopolitical tensions.

The primary technology trend highlighted here is the increasing sophistication and pervasiveness of AI systems across various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation. As these systems become more integrated into critical decision-making processes, concerns about ethical use, safety, and accountability grow.

The sectors most affected include technology and telecommunications, where AI innovation is most concentrated, as well as healthcare and public services, which increasingly rely on AI for diagnostics and resource management. This proposed international body could facilitate the establishment of standards and best practices, promoting safe and equitable AI deployment while mitigating risks related to security, privacy, and ethical considerations. Overall, it represents a crucial step towards collaborative governance in a field that will shape our future.
