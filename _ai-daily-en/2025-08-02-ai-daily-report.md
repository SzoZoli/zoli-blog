- [ASU and Berkeley Lab tools make AI safer for science](https://news.asu.edu/b/20250801-asu-and-berkeley-lab-tools-make-ai-safer-science)

A chatbot advises you to put glue on your pizza. Or eat one rock each day. Or says that your neighbor might be an alien. Today, more than 50% of Americans...

**Expert explanation:**
The recent collaboration between Arizona State University (ASU) and Berkeley Lab has resulted in the development of tools designed to enhance the safety and reliability of AI applications in scientific research. This initiative addresses a growing concern in the AI landscape: the propensity for generative AI models to produce nonsensical or harmful suggestions, such as encouraging unhealthy behaviors or promoting misinformation.

The significance of this advancement lies in its potential to improve the trustworthiness of AI-generated outputs, especially in fields where accuracy is paramount, such as healthcare, environmental science, and engineering. By implementing robust safety mechanisms, researchers and practitioners can utilize AI tools without fear of generating misleading or dangerous recommendations.

The main technology involved in this initiative includes advanced machine learning techniques aimed at refining AI training processes to ensure outputs are not only relevant but also scientifically sound. This trend reflects a broader movement towards responsible AI development, where enhancing the reliability and safety of AI systems is becoming a priority.

The sectors most affected include healthcare, where AI is increasingly used for diagnostics and treatment recommendations; environmental science, particularly in modeling climate change impacts; and academia, where AI tools assist in data analysis and hypothesis generation. By mitigating risks associated with AI misuse, this collaboration helps pave the way for safer and more effective integration of AI technologies across various scientific disciplines.

- [Artists say AI is taking their identity away](https://www.foxnews.com/shows/special-report/hollywood-turns-ai-tools-rewire-movie-magic)

Film industry embraces generative AI for visual effects and de-aging while actors secure new contract protections following Hollywood strikes over job...

**Expert explanation:**
Recent developments in the film industry highlight a significant shift towards the integration of generative AI technologies, particularly in visual effects and actor de-aging processes. This trend leverages advanced algorithms to create realistic images and animations, fundamentally changing how films are produced. 

The growing use of AI in Hollywood has sparked critical discussions among artists, particularly regarding issues of identity and artistic integrity. Many artists express concerns that AI-generated content could dilute their unique contributions and replace traditional roles, potentially undermining their careers and creative identities.

Following recent Hollywood strikes, actors have successfully negotiated new contract protections aimed at safeguarding their interests in an AI-dominated landscape. These agreements seek to define how AI can be used responsibly, ensuring that performers' likenesses and performances are protected against unauthorized replication or alteration.

The sectors most affected by this technological shift include film production, visual effects, and acting. As generative AI continues to evolve, its impact on creativity and job security in the arts will likely intensify, prompting ongoing debates about the balance between technological innovation and the preservation of human artistry.
