Rakuten and Optus both embrace agentic AI but the two telcos take different approaches to the fashionable new tool.

**Expert explanation:**
In a significant move within the telecommunications sector, Rakuten and Optus have both adopted agentic AI, a technology that enhances user interaction and decision-making capabilities by enabling systems to operate autonomously. This trend reflects a growing interest in AI systems that not only process information but also make intelligent decisions based on real-time data, thereby improving customer service and operational efficiency.

Rakuten and Optus, while both leveraging agentic AI, are employing different strategies tailored to their unique business needs. This divergence highlights the flexibility of agentic AI applications, allowing companies to customize implementations based on their service models and customer demands. The telecommunications sector, which is increasingly reliant on automation and personalized customer experiences, stands to benefit significantly from these advancements, driving innovation and competitive edge in a crowded market.

The significance of this development extends beyond mere operational improvements; it signals a broader shift in how companies interact with consumers and manage services. As agentic AI continues to evolve, it may redefine customer engagement paradigms and operational frameworks within telecommunications and other sectors that prioritize data-driven decision-making and user-centric approaches.

- [Deep-learning model for embryo selection using time-lapse imaging of matched high-quality embryos](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-10531-y)

Time-lapse imaging and deep-learning algorithms are promising tools to assess the most viable embryos and improve embryo selection in IVF laboratories.

**Expert explanation:**
Recent advancements highlight the integration of deep-learning algorithms with time-lapse imaging for embryonic selection in in-vitro fertilization (IVF). This innovative approach utilizes high-resolution, continuously captured images of embryos as they develop, allowing deep-learning models to analyze numerous morphological features and dynamics over time. 

The significance of this technology lies in its potential to enhance the accuracy of embryo selection, which traditionally relies on subjective assessments by embryologists. By employing AI, laboratories can improve success rates of embryo implantation, thereby increasing fertility treatment outcomes. 

The primary trend here is the utilization of artificial intelligence to automate and refine clinical decision-making processes in reproductive medicine. This development is particularly impactful in the healthcare sector, specifically within reproductive health and assisted reproductive technologies. As IVF practices evolve, incorporating AI-driven solutions can optimize workflows and patient success rates, ultimately transforming the landscape of fertility treatments.

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally. Ischemic stroke, strongly linked to atherosclerotic plaques, requires accurate plaque and vessel wall...

**Expert explanation:**
Recent advancements in deep learning technology have led to the development of a model that significantly enhances the speed and accuracy of stroke risk prediction. Stroke remains the second leading cause of death worldwide, with ischemic strokes, often associated with atherosclerotic plaques, being particularly critical for timely intervention. 

The main technology driving this progress is sophisticated deep learning algorithms that analyze complex medical imaging data, such as MRI and CT scans. These models can identify subtle features in plaques and vessel walls that traditional methods might miss, allowing for early and precise assessments of stroke risk.

This innovation primarily impacts the healthcare sector, especially in neurology and radiology, by facilitating early detection and preventive strategies for stroke patients. As a result, the potential to reduce stroke incidence and associated mortality could transform patient outcomes and healthcare practices globally. The integration of AI in predictive analytics represents a significant shift towards personalized medicine, ultimately enhancing public health.
